###WatchList
WatchList is a product designed to let users keep track of all the movies they have watched and which movies they enjoyed the most

####Instructions:

Due to flasks virtual environment being a bit annoying, we highly recommend opening and running the application through PyCharm. 
If you wish to run the application through the terminal please visit [Flask's](http://flask.pocoo.org) website to learn how to set it up.

Once the application is running, visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/sign-up to visit the sign up page

####Required Packages
This project was built using python 2.7 so we recommend using that for best results.

A few installations need to be made before starting the project:

`pip install flask`

`pip install flask-mysql`

Notes:

When buttons are pressed, it will appear as though nothing has happened, but reloading the page or going to the page that would be changed will show otherwise.

The biggest complication we ran into was related to keeping track of the user id of the person that was logged in and thus in order to affect different users, their ids must be manually input.
